    "# 3.6 Analysis of Relative Location\n",
    "The most widely used measures of central location and dispersion are the mean and standard deviation, respectively. Unlike the mean, the standard deviation can be hard to interpret with our intuition. All we know is that low standard deviations indicate that observations are close to the mean, while a high value shows that the observations are spread out. \n",

    "In this section we'll use Chebyshev's Theorem and the empirical rule to make more precise statements regarding the proportion of observations that fall within a specified number of standard of deviations from the mean. \n",

    "We'll see how important the standard deviation is in later chapters. The Russian mathematician Pavroty Chebyshev (1821 - 1894) found bounds for the proportion of the observations that lie within a specified number of standard deviations from the mean.\n",

    "**Chebyshev's Theorem**: For any variable, the proportion of observations that lie within $k$ standard deviations from the mean is at least $1 - 1/k^2$, where $k \\geq 1$."

Note that Chebyshev's theorem doesn't need us to assume anything about the distribution, and because of this it gave us a much more conservative estimate for the number of students scoring within two standard deviations of the mean. Indeed, our lower bound was 210, when really (when we assume normality), 266 students scored between 58 and 90. A nice lower bound, but quite conservative. \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that a z-score is a unitless measure! The units cancel out with the division, and thus it measures the distance of a given observation from the mean in terms of standard deviations. For example, a z-score of 1 implies that the given observations is 1 standard deviations above the mean. Similarly, a -2 z-score implies that the given observation is two standard deviations below the mean. Converting observations into z-scores is also called **standardizing** the observations."
