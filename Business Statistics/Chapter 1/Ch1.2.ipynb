    "# 1.2 Variables and Scales of Measurement\n",
    "A **variable** is a feature of interest that (often) differs between various observations. We can classify variables as **categorical** (qualitative) or **numerical** (quantitative). We can further distinguish numerical variables. There are **discrete variables** which are countable. For example, the number of dependents in a household. Or **continuous variables** which are uncountable variables such as time like 0.002 ms or weight 100.4312 pounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Measurement Scales\n",
    "To summarize and analyze variables we need to understand the different measurement scales used. We have four scales: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. **Nominal scale** refers to categorizations or groupings, this is the least sophisticated of the scales. In other words, the scale differentiates observations by label. Let's consider the following pandas dataframe."

    "The next scale is the **interval scale** which increases in complexity from the ordinal. We can now categorize, rank, and find meaningful differences. One example of an interval scale is the Fahrenheit scale for temperatures. An interval scale that we could apply for our politicians is a scale for their placement on the left-right political spectrum. The maindrawback of an intervale scale is that the value of zero is arbitrary. For Fahrenheit, 0 degrees does not mean an absence of temperature. It only implies 10 degrees colder than 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Similarly, a political spectrum value of 0 on a scale of $[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]$ simply implies that a candidate is in the political center, and is one step away from the center left or center right. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this scale, consider $-3$ to be far left, $-2$ to be left, $-1$ to be left, and $0$ to be center. Positive values correspond to the same, but for the political right."

An example of a ratio scale for our politicians would be the number of votes they got in their last election. For simplicity, we'll consider the \"last election\" to be the last election corresponding to the highest office level they've achieved. So for Hillary Clinton, we'll consider her $2006$ US senate election in New York, rather than her $2016$ presidential run."
